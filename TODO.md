- Execute `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename IN ('locations', 'weather_measurements')` confirms index creation
- Test constraint violations with invalid data insertions return proper error messages

### Task 2: Reference Data Population with Validation
**Technical Requirements:**
- Insert exactly 25 Romanian cities with verified latitude/longitude coordinates
- Insert exactly 10 Moldovan cities with population and timezone data
- Add 15 European capital cities for comparative weather analysis
- Implement data validation against external coordinate verification services

**Validation Steps:**
- Query `SELECT country_code, COUNT(*) FROM locations GROUP BY country_code` returns RO:25, MD:10, others:15
- Execute coordinate accuracy validation against OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- Verify timezone consistency with IANA timezone database
- Confirm no duplicate city entries exist within same country

## CRITICAL PRIORITY - MINIO STORAGE ARCHITECTURE

### Task 3: Multi-Tier Data Lake Implementation
**Technical Requirements:**
- Create bucket hierarchy: raw-weather/, processed-weather/, metadata/, genomic-raw/, genomic-processed/
- Implement lifecycle policies with automatic transition: Hot(7d) → Warm(30d) → Cold(365d) → Archive
- Configure bucket versioning with retention policies for data lineage tracking
- Set up access policies with IAM roles for service-specific permissions

**Validation Steps:**
- MinIO Console shows 5 buckets with correct naming convention
- Lifecycle policy configuration visible in bucket settings with proper transition rules
- Test file upload/download operations succeed with proper permissions
- Bucket size monitoring shows proper data classification and movement

### Task 4: Weather Collector Service Enhancement
**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement Open-Meteo API client with exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Add data quality scoring algorithm based on completeness, validity, and temporal consistency
- Create MinIO integration with date-based partitioning (YYYY/MM/DD/HH structure)
- Implement PostgreSQL bulk insert operations with UPSERT logic for data updates

**Validation Steps:**
- Container logs show successful API connections for all 35 cities
- MinIO shows proper directory structure with current date/hour partitions
- PostgreSQL weather_measurements table contains records with quality scores
- Error handling testing with API timeout scenarios shows proper retry behavior

## HIGH PRIORITY - AIRFLOW ORCHESTRATION

### Task 5: Production-Ready DAG Implementation
**Technical Requirements:**
- Create weather_collection_dag with 6-hour cron schedule using timezone-aware scheduling
- Implement dynamic task generation using Variable for city configuration
- Add task dependencies: data_quality_check → weather_collection → etl_processing → notification
- Configure SLA monitoring with 2-hour maximum execution time per run

**Validation Steps:**
- Airflow UI shows DAG with correct schedule interval and next run times
- Task dependency graph displays proper upstream/downstream relationships
- SLA alerts configured in Airflow Admin → SLAs section
- Manual trigger execution completes successfully within expected timeframe

### Task 6: ETL Pipeline with Data Lineage
**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement MinIO to PostgreSQL ETL with incremental loading based on last_processed timestamp
- Create data transformation pipeline with outlier detection using statistical z-score analysis
- Add data lineage tracking with metadata insertion for each processing batch
- Implement dead letter queue pattern for failed record handling

**Validation Steps:**
- ETL logs show batch processing statistics (records processed, rejected, inserted)
- PostgreSQL contains data_lineage table tracking source file to database record mapping
- Test incremental loading by running ETL twice - second run processes only new data
- Failed record handling creates entries in error_queue table with failure reasons

## MEDIUM PRIORITY - METABASE ANALYTICS

### Task 7: Advanced Analytics Database Integration
**Technical Requirements:**
- Deploy Metabase container with PostgreSQL metadata backend configuration
- Create analytics-specific database user with read-only permissions and query timeout limits
- Implement materialized views for complex aggregations refreshed every 6 hours
- Configure connection pooling with maximum 10 concurrent connections

**Validation Steps:**
- Metabase admin panel shows PostgreSQL connection with green status indicator
- Database user permissions verified with `\du` command showing read-only access
- Materialized views refresh automatically via scheduled PostgreSQL jobs
- Connection pool monitoring shows efficient connection utilization without exhaustion

### Task 8: Interactive Dashboard Development
**Technical Requirements:**
- Create temperature map visualization with color gradients based on statistical percentiles
- Implement time-series charts with multiple metrics (temperature, humidity, precipitation) and rolling averages
- Add real-time data refresh capability with WebSocket connections for live updates
- Configure dashboard embedding with secure token-based authentication

**Validation Steps:**
- Map visualization displays all cities with correct color coding and interactive tooltips
- Time-series charts respond to date range filters and display proper statistical aggregations
- Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 minutes showing most recent data
- Embedded dashboard URLs work correctly with authentication tokens

## FUTURE EXPANSION - GENOMIC DATA PREPARATION

### Task 9: Extended Schema for Genomic Surveillance
